Cyber Home Lab üïµÔ∏è ‚Äî pfSense + Windows Server 2022 + Windows 10 + Kali

Goal: reproducible, isolated home cyber lab for learning defensive and offensive techniques. Primary VMs:

pfSense ‚Äî virtual router/firewall (LAN = isolated lab network; WAN = NAT or bridged to host)

Windows Server 2022 ‚Äî Active Directory Domain Controller (AD DS), DNS optional

Windows 10 ‚Äî domain-joined workstation

Kali Linux ‚Äî attacker machine on isolated attacker VLAN

Planned next steps: Wazuh (SIEM), Sysmon (host EDR telemetry), Wireshark, Snort/Suricata, and controlled attacks from Kali to exercise detections
