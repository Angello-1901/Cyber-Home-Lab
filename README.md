# Cyber Home Lab üïµÔ∏è ‚Äî pfSense + Windows Server 2022 + Windows 10 + Kali

### Goal:
Reproducible, isolated home cyber lab for learning defensive and offensive techniques. Primary VMs:

* **pfSense ‚Äî** Virtual router/firewall (LAN = isolated lab network; WAN = NAT or bridged to host)

* **Windows Server 2022 ‚Äî** Active Directory Domain Controller (AD DS), DNS optional

* **Windows 10 ‚Äî** Domain-joined workstation

* **Kali Ubuntu ‚Äî** Server hosting Splunk SIEM tool and Wireshark

* **Kali Linux ‚Äî** Attacker machine on isolated attacker VLAN

* **Security Software -** Applicable to all endpoints within the LAN Network:
  - Installation and configuration of Suricata (IDS/IPS) on pfSense using open Emerging Threats Open (ET Open) ruleset
  - Installation and configuration of Sismon on endpoints for advanced log analysis (Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10)
  - Installation and configuration of Splunk UF for log forwarding to Splunk SIEM (hosted in Ubuntu Linux)
  - Enabling NTP for time synchorization on all endpoints for log tracking accuracy 

## Planned next steps: 
  - Configure Splunk alerts + correlation searches to filter false positives
  - Installation and configuration of Wireshark with port mirroring for traffic analysis
  - **Later phase:** add SOAR (Splunk Phantom) for automated response playbooks.
